        <h1>Man vs Stove</h1>
        <p>The year is 2073, and humans are faced with extinction at the hands of a sentient machine named Stove.</p>
        <p>Stove is fond of playing the game "rock, paper, scissors" as a way to teach apes a lesson about the illusion of choice.</p>
        <p>Stove challenges you. Don't panic! The game is best of 5 rounds. Choose your weapon and fight for your life...</p>
